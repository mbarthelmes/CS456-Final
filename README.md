This project is an edited version of "Marbles", winner of the Gaming Category and the Hack Choice at the 2023 YCP Hacks hackathon.

This game is a marble platformer inspired after games such as "Marble Blast Ultra" and "Marble It Up!". The game has been adjusted to have the marble go through
obstacles based on "ethical" choices. The goal is to get to the end within the time limit with a secondary objective of choosing paths based on difficulty.

The controls use "WASD" to move and "Space" to jump. You can also connect multiple devices together using an apps like "Hamachi" and play in the same lobby.
